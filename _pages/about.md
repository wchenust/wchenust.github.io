Welcome to my personal webpage! I am currently a third-year PhD student at <a href='https://hkust.edu.hk/'>The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)</a>, supervised by <a href='https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~jamesk/'>Prof. James Kwok</a>. I am also a recipient of the Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme (HKPFS).


My research focuses on multi-task training and fine-tuning of machine learning models, including CNNs, transformers, and diffusion models. If you are interested in collaboration or discussing research ideas, please feel free to contact me via wchenbx_AT_connect.ust.hk!
